# Storage {#sec-storage}

Non-digital data, such as paper forms, must be transcribed or
converted to digital file formats and then stored in the WaSHI filing
cabinet in the Natural Resources Building in Olympia.

All digital data are stored in the WSDA shared drives, and other
locations listed below.

**WSDA shared drives:**

-   Agency files:
    [Y:\\NRAS\\Soil_Health_Initiative](Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative)
-   GIS:
    [K:\\NRAS\\Arc_Data\\Soil_Health](K:\NRAS\Arc_Data\Soil_Health)
    (access requires permissions from IT)

**Esri products and services:**

-   ArcGIS Online [Soil Health - WSDA Internal
    Group](https://nras.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=17a60cfa644c4c60ab622fdd84500f8f#overview)
-   WSDA GIS on-premise [ArcGIS REST Services
    Directory](https://fortress.wa.gov/agr/gis/wsdagis/rest/services/NRAS)
    (only Jadey, Perry, and Joel can publish to this server; Ed
    Thompson is the contact for getting access)

**Database for lab results and management data:**

-   WISKI, but very likely will migrate to SQL Server or a less
    water-focused database

**GitHub organizations for code-based projects:**

-   [WSDA](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture)
-   [WaSHI](https://github.com/WASoilHealth)

**Microsoft Teams for data sharing between WSDA and WSU:**

-   WSDA and WSU Teams WaSHI channels

**Box.com for external file sharing:**

-   WSDA has a box.com account. Only Perry has a license; Jadey and
    Dani are currently editors.

**Individual devices (laptop, tablet, phone):**

-   Must NOT be the only place data are stored!

## Backup

Data must be stored in multiple locations. At a bare minimum, data on
an individual computer must also be saved on the WSDA shared drive.
Backing up data using version control (GitHub) or a cloud service
(Microsoft OneDrive or Box.com) is strongly recommended.

## Read-only raw data {#sec-raw-data}

On our shared drives, raw data such as lab results from Soiltest or
exports from ArcGIS Online, should be immediately set to `Read-only`.
Right click the file \> click on Properties \> check the `Read-only`
attribute box.

The file should then be copied over to a `Working` folder for any
processing or analyses. The final dataset should be saved in a
separate descriptively titled `Clean` folder. Keeping a `readme.txt`
to document your processing and analysis steps is good practice, as
discussed in @sec-readme.

## Version control with Git and GitHub {#sec-version-control}

A version control system records changes to a file or set of files
over time. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-source
distributed version control system and [GitHub](https://github.com) is
the hosting site WSDA and WaSHI use to interface with this system. Git
and GitHub are an important foundation of reproducible statistical and
data scientific workflows [@bryan2018].

A major benefit of using version control is ensuring changes are well
documented and previous versions are accessible if any changes must be
recalled. Additionally, version control makes collaboration across
projects much more robust.

Version control is not just for code either! It's useful for scripts,
documents, presentations, and books (like this DMP!). Instead of
saving each version of a file with a different name (i.e.,
`Report_V01.docx` and `Report_V02.docx`; for a reminder on version
naming, see [@sec-version-numbers]), there's only one file
`Report.docx` which automatically has its history and editors saved
with Git and GitHub.

In the screenshot below, you can see who made a commit (which is
basically a named version of changes), when that commit was made, and
you can click on the commit message to view all of the files that were
changed.

After clicking on the first commit message, we see the
`documentation.qmd` file was changed with additions highlighted in
green and deletions highlighted in red.

### Privacy considerations

Review @sec-sharing to categorize the data included in the repository. If the data are not anonymized and aggregated, either 1) the repository must be [set to private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) or 2) data files and any scripts containing Category 3 data as described in @sec-category-3 must be added to the [.gitignore](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files) file. 

### Git and GitHub resources

Read Jenny Bryan's article [*Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk
About Version
Control*](Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative\StateOfTheSoils\DataManagement\Resources\Bryan_ExcuseMeDoYouHaveMomentTalkVersionControl.pdf)
for a great background on Git and GitHub, why we should be using it,
and a brief how to get started. For detailed instructions , please
follow along with Jenny Bryan's free online book [*Happy Git and
GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/). Another helpful
book resource is [*GitHub: A Beginner's
Guide*](https://birdscanada.github.io/BirdsCanada_GitHubGuide/), which
was created by Birds Canada (avian conservation NGO) for people
without a lot of programming background.

If you prefer to look through slides, check out Byron C. Jaeger's
presentation [*Happier version control with Git and GitHub (and
RStudio)*](https://bcjaeger.github.io/seminar-git/)*.*

## Staff turnover

When staff leave our group, they take their skills, institutional
knowledge, and personal understanding of their file management with
them. Proper offboarding is essential to ensure knowledge isn't lost,
time isn't wasted trying to recreate workflows, and projects keep
moving.

Before the employee leaves, the Senior Soil Scientist and Data
Scientist ensure that:

-   Folders and files are moved from the employee's personal drive to
    the shared drive. They are named and organized according to
    [@sec-naming].
-   Workflows and specific processes the employee was responsible for
    are well documented.
-   Permissions and ownerships are transferred to the appropriate
    remaining staff.
    -   [GitHub WSDA
        organization](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture)
    -   ArcGIS data products and online groups
    -   Database credentials
    -   Box.com folders

More resources and offboarding checklists from [Harvard Research Data
Management](Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative\StateOfTheSoils\DataManagement\Resources\StaffTurnover)
can be found in our [DataManagement shared
drive](Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative\StateOfTheSoils\DataManagement\Resources\StaffTurnover).

# Storage {#sec-storage}

Non-digital data, such as paper forms, must be transcribed or converted to digital file formats and then stored in the WaSHI filing cabinet in the Natural Resources Building in Olympia.

All digital data are stored in the WSDA shared drives, and other locations listed below.

**WSDA shared drives:**

-   Agency files: [Y:\\NRAS\\Soil_Health_Initiative](Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative)
-   GIS: [K:\\NRAS\\Arc_Data\\Soil_Health](K:\NRAS\Arc_Data\Soil_Health) (access requires permissions from IT)

**Esri products and services:**

-   ArcGIS Online [Soil Health - WSDA Internal Group](https://nras.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=17a60cfa644c4c60ab622fdd84500f8f#overview)
-   WSDA GIS on-premise [ArcGIS REST Services Directory](https://fortress.wa.gov/agr/gis/wsdagis/rest/services/NRAS) (only Jadey, Perry, and Joel can publish to this server; Ed Thompson is the contact for getting access)

**Database for lab results and management data:**

-   WISKI, but very likely will migrate to SQL Server or a less water-focused database

**GitHub organizations for code-based projects:**

-   [WSDA](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture)
-   [WaSHI](https://github.com/WASoilHealth)

**Microsoft Teams for data sharing between WSDA and WSU:**

-   WSDA and WSU Teams WaSHI channels

**Local workstations:**

-   Should NOT be the only place data are stored!

## Read-only raw data {#sec-raw-data}

On our shared drives, raw data such as lab results from Soiltest or exports from ArcGIS Online, should be immediately set to `Read-only`. Right click the file \> click on Properties \> check the `Read-only` attribute box.

The file should then be copied over to a `Working` folder for any processing or analyses. The final dataset should be saved in a separate descriptively titled `Clean` folder. Keeping a `README.txt` to document your processing and analysis steps is good practice, as discussed in @sec-readme.

## Data formats

Data generated from or integrated into WaSHI can be non-digital or digital.

### Non-digital data

Non-digital data, such as field forms, management surveys, and chain of custody
forms, are manually recorded on paper forms. Paper forms must be transcribed or
converted to digital file formats and then stored in the WaSHI filing cabinet in
the Natural Resources Building in Olympia.

### Digital data

Digital data include tabular, spatial, and binary data, such as lab results,
sample locations, and field photos. Non-conventional data also include code,
algorithms, tools, and workflows.

**Tabular data** include comma separated values (csv), tab separated values
(tsv), Microsoft Excel open XML spreadsheet (xlsx), and portable document format
(pdf).

**Spatial data** include file geodatabases (gdb), vector shapefiles (zipped
folder containing multiple file extensions), keyhole markup language (kml or
kmz). Tabular data may also contain spatial data such as longitude and latitude.

**Binary data** include photos (jpeg, png, gif, tiff), videos (mp4), code (R,
py, js), and object-oriented data files (RDS, Rdata, parquet, arrow).

**Proprietary data formats** include Microsoft Excel, Word, and Powerpoint files
(xlsx, docx, pptx). RDS and RData files are examples of application-specific
data formats that can only be opened using the R programming language or RStudio
IDE. These types of files should be saved in conjunction with a copy of the data
in a non-proprietary and open-standard format, such as csv, to maintain
accessibility for those who do not have Microsoft Office or do not use R.

**Written documents and presentations** are in formats including Microsoft Word
and PowerPoint (docx and pptx), hypertext markup language (HTML), and pdf.

**Notebooks** combine text with executable code to generate written documents
and presentations in docx, pptx, html, or pdf formats. These notebooks are
stored in formats depending on the programming language: a few examples include
R markdown (rmd), Quarto (qmd), and Jupyter notebook (ipynb).

The list below is not exhaustive and will continue to grow as additional data
sources are discovered.

**Geospatial** data will be accompanied by metadata that abides by the [ISO
19115 standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html) and follows Esri's
[documentation](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/metadata/create-iso-19115-and-iso-19139-metadata.htm)
when using ArcGIS Pro. Metadata contains information about the identification,
extent, quality, spatial and temporal schema, spatial reference, and
distribution of digital geographic data.

**Code** will follow the style guide in @sec-code-style-guide.

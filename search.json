WaSHI establishes a coordinated approach to healthy soil in Washington.\nTo date, nearly 1,000 soil samples and management surveys across 50 different cropping systems have been collected as a part of the state of the soils assessment (SoSA). WSDA and WSU lead this project with support from staff, students, conservation districts, and agricultural professionals throughout Washington."

    "text": "1.1 What is data management?\nEffective data management involves properly documenting, storing, and sharing our data and the information we derive from the data. If the data aren’t useable by researchers, policymakers, or growers, the hours spent in the field collecting soil samples and the hours spent in the lab analyzing them may be wasted.\nThe guidelines detailed in this DMP will help us achieve the above data-driven goals, while also optimizing the value of the data by supporting information sharing and innovation. Our data management strategies attempt to follow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles while also maintaining data privacy (Wilkinson et al. 2016)."

    "text": "1.2 Data life cycle\n\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service developed a great illustration of the data life cycle that shows the elements of data management and emphasizes the importance of data quality at every step (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2023). Each step within the data life cycle requires careful intention to ensure transparency, quality, and integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur adaptation of this data life cycle is outlined below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan\nEach sampling year presents an opportunity to consider what worked and what could be improved from the previous year. Planning involves making decisions about data acquisition, management, and quality control. For example, each year we provide a spreadsheet template with our requested column headers to Soiltest lab to ensure the measurements are reported with correct units and in the format we use. Special projects that deviate from our standard operating procedures require additional planning.\n\n\n\nAcquire\nWe acquire data by collecting and analyzing new samples, deriving new insights from existing data, or accepting data sets from collaborators.\n\n\n\nMaintain\nMaintenance involves processing data for aggregation, analyses, and reporting. We create metadata that facilitates interpretation of the data and ensure the data are in a non-proprietary format that is accessible to our collaborators and future selves.\n\n\n\nAccess\nAccess refers to data storage, publication, and security. Raw and processed data with accompanying metadata should be stored, backed up, and available for information sharing with our partners. With PI approval, anonymized and aggregated data that does not compromise growers’ personally identifiable information (PII) should be made publicly available in a data repository or data product/decision-support tool.\n\n\n\nEvaluate\nWe evaluate data while processing and analyzing it to maximize accuracy and productivity, while minimizing costs associated with errors or tedious data cleaning labor. Evaluation workflows should be efficient, well-documented, and reproducible. Our evaluated data help us better understand how factors and management decisions impact soil health.\n\n\n\nArchive\nProperly archiving our results supports the long-term storage and usefulness of our data. While similar to the Access element of the life cycle, archiving focuses on preserving data for long-term/historical retention that aren’t needed for immediate access. For example, we archive each year’s raw data for long-term storage and set those files to Read-Only.\n\n\n\nQuality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC)\nData quality management prevents data defects that hinder our ability to apply data towards our science-based conservation efforts. Defects include incorrectly entered data, invalid data, and missing or lost data. QA/QC processes should be incorporated in every element of the data life cycle."

    "section": "3.2 Naming conventions",
    "text": "3.2 Naming conventions\nWhen naming folders and files, we want consistent and clear names that are findable and understandabe by both humans and computers. From only a file name, we should immediately know what the file contains and which file is the most recent version.\n\n\n\n“Documents” from Randall Munroe’s xkcd\n\n\n\nBest practices\n\nConvey meaning with delimiters and capitalization\nDeliberately use underscores, hyphens, and uppercase letters so we can easily understand the contents and programmatically parse file and folder names.\n\nUse underscores to delineate metadata elements (i.e. name from version Name_Version).\nUse hyphens to separate parts of one metadata element (i.e. date YYYY-MM-DD).\nDifferent conventions may work better for different purposes (folder, file, variable name). See Section 3.2.2 for which conventions to use for different file sets.\n\nPascalCase: capitalize the first letter of each word without spaces or delimiters.\nlowerCamelCase: the first word is all lowercase and subsequent words have the first letter capitalized without spaces or delimiters.\nsnake_case: all lowercase with underscores separating words\nkebab-case: all lowercase with hyphens separating words\nTrain-Case: each word begins with an uppercase letter with hyphens separating words\n\n\nAvoid spaces and special characters (only use underscores and hyphens). Characters like / () ! ? % + \" ' have special meaning to computers and can break file paths and URLs.\n\n\nCharacter length matters\nComputers are unable to read file paths and file names that surpass a certain character length. Be concise AND descriptive. Windows path limit is 260 characters.\n\n\nGroup and sort files by name\nConsider how folders and files should be grouped and sorted. Put that piece of metadata in the beginning of the file name. For example, if we want all chain of custodies grouped by conservation district and then sorted by date, we would use DistrictName_CoC_YYYY-MM-DD, which looks like Cowlitz_CoC_2023-05-01.pdf. If we wanted them grouped by date, we would put the date at the beginning.\n\n\n\nUse version numbers\nIf not using the date to version, or to keep multiple drafts from the same date, add version information to the end of the file name. Think about how many possible versions there could be. If there may be more than 10, use leading zeros before single digit numbers so the file name always has the same length. V1 through V15 will not sort the same way as V01 through V15. For example: 2023 SampleRequestForm_Lewis_V3 or 2023 SampleRequestForm_Lewis_V03.\n\n\nCollaborating on files\nAdd your initials at the end of the file name when “saving as” a file that multiple people are working on. This ensures a version is kept as a backup. Alternatively, use Track Changes if working in a MS Word document.\n\n\n\nNaming guidelines\nMany files and folders in our shared drive do not follow the above best practices or below naming conventions. We are learning and improving as we go. Going forward, please follow the conventions listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming convention\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nFolders\nYYYY_PascalCase\noptional: year\n2024_Sampling\nDataManagement\n\n\nDynamic files\n(include metadata in name)\nYYYY-MM-DD_PascalCase_V1\n2023-11-15_SurveyPerennial.xlsx\n2023_WSDASoilHealth_V1.xlsx\n2023_WADE-WaSHI-WaCSE_JR.pptx\n\n\nStatic files\nsnake_case\nwashi_logo_no_background.png\n\n\nDomains1\nkebab-case\nwashi-dmp\n\n\nScripts and syntax2\nsnake_case\nlowerCamelCase\ncreate_soils.R (script)\nwashi_flextable (function)\nsampleId (variable)"

If too shallow, there are too many files in one folder and they are hard to sort through. If too deep, we have to click too many times to get to a file and specific files can be difficult to find.\nY:\\NRAS\\Soil_Health_Initiative is the parent folder for all WaSHI content.\nWithin the Sampling sub-folder, we use a combination of date- (each year has its own sub-folder) and categorical- based (data set and documentation that span across years) folder structure .\nY:\\NRAS\\Soil_Health_Initiative\\Sampling\n├── _completeDataset\n├── 2019_SCBG\n├── 2021_Sampling\n├── 2022_PartnershipsInSoilHealth\n├── 2023_Sampling\n├── 2024_Sampling\n├── Maps\n├── Projects\n├── QAPP\n├── SOPs\n├── TrainingVideos\n├── ArchivedSampleInventory.xlsx\n├── EquipmentInventory.xlsx\n└──  SOSImpacts.xlsx\nWithin the 2023 sub-folder, we have sub-folders for planning, forms, data, and processes.

We wouldn’t want to add too many more levels before the hierarchy becomes difficult to manage.\n\n\nArchive folders\nWhen too many drafts or versions begin to clutter a sub-folder, create a new folder with the structure Archive_FileTitleOrDescription and place the old drafts there. Leave the most current, accurate file in the main folder.\nFor example, the final, current SOP is listed in the main folder and previous working drafts were moved to the Archive_SOP folder.\nY:\\NRAS\\Soil_Health_Initiative\\Sampling\\SOPs\\Sampling\n├── 2023_WSDA_NRAS_SOP_Soil_Health_Monitoring.docx\n├── 2023_WSDA_NRAS_SOP_Soil_Health_Monitoring_WEB.docx\n├── 923-NRAS-SoilHealthSOP.pdf\n├── 923-NRAS-SoilHealthSOP_WEB.pdf\n├── Archive_SOP\n│   ├── 2021\n│   ├── 2022\n│   ├── 2023\n│   │   ├── 2023_WSDA_NRAS_SOP_Soil_Health_Monitoring_LMedits.docx\n│   │   └── 2023_WSDA_NRAS_SOP_Soil_Health_Monitoring_LM_JRedits.docx"

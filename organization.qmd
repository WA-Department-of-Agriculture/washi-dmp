## Organization

We organize our folders into a hierarchical structure to clearly delineate segments of our projects, improve searchability, and ensure reproducibility across years.

### Folder Structure

We strive for a balance between a deep and shallow structure. If too shallow, there are too many files in one folder and they are hard to sort through. If too deep, we have to click too many times to get to a file and specific files can be difficult to find.

`Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative` is the parent folder for all WaSHI content.

Within the `Sampling` sub-folder, we use a combination of **date-** (each year has its own sub-folder) and **categorical-** based (dataset and documentation that span across years) folder structures.

```         
Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative\Sampling
├── _completeDataset
├── 2019_SCBG
├── 2021_Sampling
├── 2022_PartnershipsInSoilHealth
├── 2023_Sampling
├── 2024_Sampling
├── Maps
├── Projects
├── QAPP
├── SOPs
├── TrainingVideos
├── ArchivedSampleInventory.xlsx
├── EquipmentInventory.xlsx
└── SOSImpacts.xlsx
```

Within the each year sub-folder, we have sub-sub-folders for planning, forms, data, and processes. This structure helps maintain a reproducible workflow year after year. See the `2023_Sampling` for an example:

```         
Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative\Sampling\2023_Sampling
├── Applications
├── CoCs
├── Equipment
├── FieldForms
├── Forms
├── GIS
├── LabData
├── Labels
├── ManagementSurveys
├── PublicDocs
├── Purchases
├── Reports
├── SampleIDAssignments
├── Scripts
├── 2023_DataTracking.xlsx
└── PostSeasonWrapUp_2023.docx
```

As mentioned in @sec-raw-data, it's good practice to maintain the raw data. We use additional sub-folders for the `LabData` folder. Everything in `Raw` has been set as `Read-Only`.

```         
Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative\Sampling\2023_Sampling\LabData
├── 2023_DataTemplateSoiltest.xlsx
├── Clean
├── QC
├── Raw
└── Working
```

`Soil_Health_Initative` \> `Sampling` \> `2023_Sampling` \> `LabData` \> `Clean` already has five levels of nesting. We wouldn't want to add any many more levels or the hierarchy becomes difficult to manage.

### Archive folders

When too many drafts or versions begin to clutter a sub-folder, create a new folder with the naming convention of `Archive_FolderDescription`. Place the old drafts there. Leave the most current, accurate file in the main folder.

For example, the most recent sample labels for each conservation district are listed in the top level `CompletedLabels` folder, and previous working drafts were moved to the `Archive_Labels` folder.

```         
Y:\NRAS\Soil_Health_Initiative\Sampling\2023_Sampling\Labels\CompletedLabels
├── Archive_Labels
│   ├── CowlitzCounty_Labels.docx
│   ├── FerryCD_Labels.docx
│   ├── LewisCD_Labels.docx
│   └── StevensCD_Labels.docx
├── CowlitzCounty_Labels_V2.docx
├── FerryCD_Labels_V2.docx
├── KittitasCD_Labels.docx
├── LewisCD_Labels_V2.docx
├── ...
└── WallaWallaCD_Labels.docx
```

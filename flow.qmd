# Data flow

Data flow refers to how information moves through a system and how it's
processed along the way. This chapter outlines how our data are generated,
processed, and moved from start to finish.

This chapter is subject to lots of changes as 2024 is the final year of our soil
sampling program through funding conservation district (CD). However, since the
CDs are now trained according to the WSDA SOP, we will accept their data
provided they also submit management surveys. More details on this process are
TBD. Additionally, we do not yet have a database so the importing to the
database section will be completed in the future.

2020 - 2023 data and scripts are housed in the `soils-internal` [monolithic
repository](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils-internal).
Moving forward, each year (or special project) should have its own project and
repository.

## Pre field season

### Assign unique identifiers

Before sample IDs can be assigned, collect the following information for each
proposed sample:

-   County
-   Organization of sampling team
-   Farm name (optional)
-   Producer name
-   Producer contact information (optional)
-   Field name
-   Crop
-   General management practice (i.e., conventional, cover crop, reduced
    tillage)

View examples of the 2023 [Sample Request
Form](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/SampleIDAssignments/SampleRequestForm.xlsx)
sent to CDs and the [Berries Sample Request
Form](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/SampleIDAssignments/Berries/SampleRequestForm_Berries)
for the WSDA/WSU special project.

Once producers and fields have been identified, we assign a unique ID for the
producer, field, and sample.

-   Producer ID: first three letters of county + three-digit landowner number
    -   `WHA001`
-   Field ID: two-digit field number
    -   `01` and `02`
-   Pair ID (optional): letter extension added to paired fields
    -   `A`
-   Sample ID: last two digits of year + Producer ID + Field ID + Pair ID
    -   `24-WHA001-01-A` and `24-WHA001-02-A`

The following counties have different abbreviations than the first three
letters:

-   Clallam → CLL
-   Grays Harbor → GRY
-   Kitsap → KIS
-   Skamania → SKM

Producer and field IDs should first be matched to previous participants. New
producers and fields should continue the previous sequence. There should be no
duplicate producer IDs or sample IDs.

For an example R script to automate this process, see
[assign_sample_ids.R](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/SampleIDAssignments/assign_sample_ids.R).

### Create sample labels

We automate sample label creation using R and Microsoft Word's [mail merge
tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-use-the-mail-merge-feature-in-word-to-create-and-to-print-form-letters-that-use-the-data-from-an-excel-worksheet-d8709e29-c106-2348-7e38-13eecc338679).
[labels.R](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/Labels/labels.R)
generates a
[spreadsheet](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/Labels/Combined_Labels.xlsx)
with all column names to be printed on the labels. Then
[LabelsTemplate_MailMerge.docx](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/Labels/LabelsTemplate_MailMerge.docx)
ingests this spreadsheet and the data scientist runs the mail merge to generate
a [word
document](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/Labels/AllLabelsCombined.docx)
with all of the labels to be printed, as shown in the [CompletedLabels
folder](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/Labels/CompletedLabels).

### Create a data tracking sheet

We keep a spreadsheet to track which pieces of data we have for each sample ID,
including:

-   GPS points submitted through the ArcGIS Field Maps field form
-   Scanned paper field forms are received (for those who can't use ArcGIS Field
    Maps)
-   Management surveys through ArcGIS Survey123
-   Scanned chain of custodies with shipping tracking numbers
-   Location of archival falcon tubes
-   Notes for if a sample will no longer be sampled, a sample ID was changed,
    etc.

See the [2023
spreadsheet](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/2023_DataTracking.xlsx)
for an example.

### Develop ArcGIS web tools

We use ArcGIS to build tools for managing spatial data and collecting management
survey data. A sample selection feature layer is hosted and a web map with
offline capabilities is created using ArcGIS Pro. Domains are used for point
numbers, bulk density, and crop types. Then, a field form is created on ArcGIS
Online using Field Maps. Management surveys are created and hosted with
Survey123 and Experience Builder. We also use an ArcGIS Notebook with python to
back up our feature layer and survey data.

This [template ArcGIS Pro
project](K:/NRAS/Arc_Data/Soil_Health/WaSHI_GIS_Projects/Template_SoilSamplePoints)
includes a
[README.txt](K:/NRAS/Arc_Data/Soil_Health/WaSHI_GIS_Projects/Template_SoilSamplePoints/README.txt)
that describes this process.

The ArcGIS Notebook is set to run as a task Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during
the field season.

## During field season

Data collection in the field is detailed in the [monitoring
SOP](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/SOPs/Sampling/). We'll focus
on the behind-the scenes tasks for managing data.

### Update data tracking spreadsheet

Throughout the season, the data tracking spreadsheet must be updated as various
data, as described in [Create a data tracking sheet] are received.

### Modify IDs when samples change

Sometimes a producer can no longer participate, or they want to change which
field is sampled. The sample request form should be updated, versioned, and
archived (`SampleRequestForm_Ferry.xlsx` → `SampleRequestForm_Ferry_V2.xlsx`).

The `assign_sample_ids.R` script should be run again to update the sample IDs.
Lines 362 - 386 should be commented out as shown in the [highlighted lines of
the script on
GitHub](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils-internal/blob/2f7ed5a621a7254835b3f3126acecf0c6ed72b00/R/assign_sample_ids.R#L362-L386).

Take a look through the
[01.ReturnedSampleRequests](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/SampleIDAssignments/01.ReturnedSampleRequests)
and
[02.CompletedSampleRequests](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/2023_Sampling/SampleIDAssignments/02.CompletedSampleRequests)
folders for an example of this flow.

A concise, explanatory note should be added to the data tracking spreadsheet.

## Post field season

### Organize multiple sources of data

We have many sources of data such as the initial sample request forms, ArcGIS
Field Maps field forms, and management surveys. To organize these multiple
sources into a single source of truth, we cross-reference each source and reach
out to the sampling teams to resolve conflicting information. This is especially
important for verifying the crop that was planted at the time of sampling.

See how to *mostly* automate this process in these
[01_loadMetadata.R](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils-internal/blob/2f7ed5a621a7254835b3f3126acecf0c6ed72b00/R/01_loadMetadata.R)
and
[02_checkCrops.R](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils-internal/blob/2f7ed5a621a7254835b3f3126acecf0c6ed72b00/R/02_checkCrops.R)
scripts.

### Process lab data

Follow the [QA/QC
SOP](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/SOPs/QC/2022_WaSHI_QC_SOP.docx)
for processing the lab data.

See the 2023 processing scripts and QA/QC report:

-   [03_processSpatialData.R](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils-internal/blob/2f7ed5a621a7254835b3f3126acecf0c6ed72b00/R/03_processSpatialData.R)

-   [2020-2023_QCresultsSummary.qmd](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils-internal/blob/main/inst/2020-2023_QCresultsSummary.qmd)

### Generate reports

Use the [{soils}](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils) package
to create a new project for each year. To avoid attachment size limitations of
emails, reports are saved to
[Box.com](https://agriculture.app.box.com/folder/136923153810?s=l3q9zq2p4yv38891d3q3753ybs6t0lec)
for distribution to the sampling partners who will send the reports to the
participants.

### Import data to database

TBD. Currently data are only in spreadsheets.

### Save data to shared drive and WSU Teams channel

The output data files and reports from [Process lab data] and [Generate reports]
are copied to the
[StateOfTheSoils](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils) folder in the
relevant folders. Review [@sec-organization] and look at previous years in the
shared drive to follow the same folder structure and organization.

The final datasets in wide and long formats should also be saved to the WSU SCBG
Soil Health Assessment Teams channel. If you don't have access to the
[\_complete_SoSA_Dataset
folder](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/cahnrs.scbgsoilhealthassessment/Shared%20Documents/General/Data/Data%20for%20stats/_complete_SoSA_Dataset?csf=1&web=1&e=Xo490w),
email it to Deirdre Griffin-LaHue.

### Archive jars and falcon tubes

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Subsamples in glass jars are stored in the Yakima WSDA storage room and the
cryogenic archive subsamples in falcon tubes are stored in the -80 °C freezer at
the [WSU Mount Vernon Northwestern Washington Research & Extension
Center](https://mtvernon.wsu.edu/).

Labels on the falcon tubes must be taped with a generous amount of packing tape
to avoid falling off as they stiffen up and flatten out when they freeze.

The [archive
spreadsheet](Y:/NRAS/Soil_Health_Initiative/StateOfTheSoils/ArchivedSampleInventory.xlsx)
must be updated.

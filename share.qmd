# Data sharing {#sec-sharing}

## Data sharing and public access

SoSA relies on growers' willingness to volunteer their fields for sampling and participate in the required management survey. Their willingness depends on their trust in WaSHI to protect their privacy. Only aggregated and anonymized results will be publicly available or shared. The below data privacy statement may be shared with potential participants:

### Data privacy statement

> Data will be aggregated and reported in a way which mitigates personal identification of growers. Information will be used to understand broad impacts and characterize trends in soil health and production practices across regions. Results will not be reported in a way that makes individuals identifiable. Information collected in this survey may be subject to release in accordance with RCW 42.56 (Public Records Act).

Procedures for anonymizing data are detailed in @sec-maintain-confidentiality.

### Acknowledging WaSHI data in publications

All research partially or completely funded by WaSHI must include acknowledgements to the State of Washington. The following text should be included in all publications resulting from this funding:

> Data was in part provided by the Washington Soil Initiative, which is supported by the State of Washington and administered by the Washington State Department of Agriculture, Washington State Conservation Commission, and Washington State University.

If WaSHI staff make [substantial scientific contributions](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1715374115) to the manuscript, discuss the possibility of co-authorship credit.

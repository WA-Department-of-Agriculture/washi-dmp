# Data sharing {#sec-sharing}

Our data sharing policies promote FAIR principles so our data are "**as open as
possible, as closed as necessary**" [@europeancommission2016]. Data should be
**open** enough to facilitate efficient re-use; avoid duplicating data
collection efforts; enhance scholarly rigor; and promote engagement across the
research and public communities [@whyte2011]. However, data must also be
**closed** enough to protect grower privacy and to honor agreements with growers
and other researchers [@czarnecki2022; @korzekwa2023].

The SOS relies on growers' willingness to volunteer their fields for sampling and
participate in the required management survey. Their willingness depends on
their trust in WaSHI to protect their privacy. Only aggregated and anonymized
results will be publicly available or shared. The below data privacy statement
may be shared with potential participants.

### Data privacy statement

> All survey responses will be combined across all respondents. Results will not
> be reported in a way that makes individuals identifiable. Information
> collected in this survey are subject to release in accordance with RCW 42.56
> (Public Records Act).

Procedures for anonymizing data are detailed in @sec-maintain-confidentiality.

## WaTech data categorization

Under Washington State [Policy 141.10 (Securing Information Technology
Assets)](https://watech.wa.gov/policies/securing-information-technology-assets),
state agencies must classify data into categories based on the sensitivity of
the data. WaTech provides
[guidance](https://watech.wa.gov/Categorizing-Data-State-Agency) on the four
categories of data.

#### Category 4: "Confidential information requiring special handling"

**WaTech**: Data requires strict handling requirements applied by statues or regulations.

**SOS**: Not applicable.

#### Category 3: "Confidential information" {#sec-category-3}

**WaTech**: Data includes "personal information" as defined in [RCW
42.56.590](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.590) (Security
Breaches) and [RCW
19.255.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.255.010) (Personal
Information Disclosure). An individual's first name or first initial and last
name *in combination* with at least one of the following elements: social
security number, driver's license or Washington identification card number, or
any account numbers that permit access to their financial account.

**SOS**: We do not collect the above elements in combination with grower names.
However, we treat individual names, farm names, and latitude and longitude
coordinates as confidential information.

#### Category 2: "Sensitive information"

**WaTech**: Data are intended for official use only and withheld unless
specifically requested.

**SOS**: This category includes lab results and management surveys. Access to
this data requires a [data share agreement].

#### Category 1: "Public information"

**WaTech**: Data is not covered in any of the above categories or is already
released to the public.

**SOS**: De-identified and aggregated data, such as the number of soil samples
and from which counties and crops they were collected, fall under this category.
For example, the [SOS
dashboard](https://nras.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d4b2d135d47a4ff7a89285fecf67cef2)
is publicly available and the map zoom is disabled at the 1:1,600,000 scale
(counties level).

## Maintain confidentiality {#sec-maintain-confidentiality}

Only under special circumstances and with proper justification in the [data
share agreement] will the following Category 3 data be released to external
collaborators. Under no circumstances will these data be made publicly
available.

-   Farm name
-   Grower first and last name
-   Field names that contain street names or other identifying information
-   Latitude and longitude coordinates or other geospatial identifiers
-   Any information identifying the individual farm or grower

Anonymize and aggregate Category 2 data to honor our [data privacy
statement] by either removing or replacing Category 3 confidential information
with dummy data. The [{randomNames}](https://centerforassessment.github.io/randomNames/) R package
can be used to replace real names with fake names. Round latitude and longitude to a precision that does not identify the farm or fields sampled.

## Data share agreement

SOS CoPIs created a [Data Sharing and Scope of Work Agreement](Y:/NRAS/soil-health-initiative/state-of-the-soils/data-sharing/sos-data-share-agreement.pdf) detailing the type of data to be shared, the scope of work in which the data
may be used, and terms for using SOS data.

Once both CoPIs and the "Partnering
Scientists" sign the agreement, save it in its own subfolder within
[Y:/NRAS/soil-health-initiative/state-of-the-soils/data-sharing](Y:/NRAS/soil-health-initiative/state-of-the-soils/data-sharing). If this agreement is part of a grant, place a copy in its corresponding grant subfolder within [Y:/NRAS/soil-health-initiative/contracts-grants/grants](Y:/NRAS/soil-health-initiative/contracts-grants/grants). Include relevant correspondence, code to subset the requested data, and final dataset in the agreement's subfolder in the `data-sharing` folder. This documentation allows us to track publications, attributions, and the broader impact of the SOS dataset.

## Public access

Currently, the only publicly available SOS data are the counts of samples across
the project, counties, and crop types displayed in the [ArcGIS Online
Dashboard](https://nras.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d4b2d135d47a4ff7a89285fecf67cef2).

A small, anonymized subset is included as example data in the
[{washi}](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/washi) and
[{soils}](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils) R packages for
demonstration purposes.

When the data are more mature and hosted in a proper database, we
may publish an anonymized subset in a public repository such as:

-   GitHub via an R package or Shiny app
-   [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): integrates with GitHub and is citable with a
    DOI
-   [Data.WA.gov](https://data.wa.gov/): open data portal for the State of
    Washington

More inspiration for enhancing data discoverability and sharing across
the agricultural and soil health communities include:

-   [USDA LTAR data dashboards](https://ltar.ars.usda.gov/data/data-dashboards)
-   [CAF LTAR metadata tool](https://meta.cafltar.org/)

[Chapter 16](https://datamgmtinedresearch.com/share) of *Data Management in
Large-Scale Education Research* discusses more considerations for data sharing
and choosing public repositories [@lewis2023].

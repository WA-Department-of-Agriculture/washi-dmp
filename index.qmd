The [Washington Soil Health Initiative](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/) (WaSHI) is a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), Washington State University (WSU), and the State Conservation Commission. WaSHI establishes a coordinated approach to healthy soil in Washington.

To date, nearly 1,000 soil samples and management surveys across 50 different cropping systems have been collected as a part of the [State of the Soils Assessment](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/state-of-the-soils/) (SOS). WSDA and WSU lead this project with support from staff, students, conservation districts, and agricultural professionals throughout Washington.

## Chapter outline

**This Data Management Plan (DMP) is a living document to be continually reviewed and improved based on lessons learned, new information, and collaborator feedback.**

@sec-data-management describes what data management is, how it is crucial to achieve our data-driven goals, and how our data move through the data life cycle.

@sec-formats-standards describes the various data formats we collect and manage. [ISO standards](https://www.iso.org/standards.html) are also described for date and geospatial data.

@sec-naming describes naming conventions, best practices, and examples for how we name folders and files.

@sec-organization describes how we organize our folders into a hierarchical structure.

@sec-storage describes where we store data, what our backup policies are, how we protect our raw data, and how we use version control.

@sec-documentation describes how we record each element of the data life cycle with project-level, dataset-level, and variable-level documents such as standard operating procedures, readme files, data dictionaries, etc.

@sec-flow describes how data are generated, processed, and moved from start to finish. Processes and tasks are grouped by pre, during, and post field season.

@sec-sharing describes how we protect producer privacy; how our data fits into [WaTech data categories](https://watech.wa.gov/Categorizing-Data-State-Agency); requirements and processes for maintaining confidentiality; and our data share agreement, public access policies, and our preferred acknowledgements.

@sec-code-style-guide describes our recommended project structures, code-specific naming conventions, script structures, and code style.

## Links to shared drive folders and files

This DMP is best viewed in Google Chrome since the browser can open links to our local folders and files using the [Enable local file links extension](chrome://extensions/?id=nikfmfgobenbhmocjaaboihbeocackld) that should automatically be enabled by our organization.

However, when viewing this DMP in Microsoft Edge, links to our shared drive are not accessible in the browser. Nothing happens if you click on these links. To open the file or folder, right-click on the hyperlink \> copy the path \> paste it into the search bar of the file explorer \> press `Enter` or click the arrow.

## Roles and responsibilities

All WaSHI personnel who will be interacting with SOS data must familiarize themselves with the contents of this document. If all collaborators are not consistently implementing this DMP, then the benefits of effective data management are lost.

The WSDA Data Scientist, supported by the Co- Principal Investigators (CoPIs), is responsible for providing guidance to WaSHI staff working with SOS data and ensuring the implementation of this DMP. The Data Scientist is also responsible for reviewing and updating this document annually, and as needed. Upon updates, the Data Scientist will distribute this document to WaSHI staff and commit the source code to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/washi-dmp).

| Role          | Affiliation     | Name                  | Title                 |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| CoPI          | WSDA            | Dani Gelardi          | Senior Soil Scientist |
| CoPI          | WSU             | Deirdre Griffin LaHue | Assistant Professor   |
| Data Manager  | WSDA            | Jadey Ryan            | Data Scientist        |
| Data Stewards | WaSHI personnel |                       |                       |

: Current roles as of January 2024

## Staff turnover

When staff leave our group, they take their skills, institutional knowledge, and personal understanding of their file management with them. Proper offboarding is essential to ensure knowledge isn't lost, time isn't wasted trying to recreate workflows, and projects keep moving.

Before the employee leaves, the Senior Soil Scientist and Data Scientist ensure that:

-   Folders and files are moved from the employee's personal drive to the shared drive. They are named and organized according to [@sec-naming].
-   Workflows and specific processes the employee was responsible for are well documented.
-   Permissions and ownerships are transferred to the appropriate remaining staff.
    -   [GitHub WSDA organization](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture)
    -   ArcGIS data products and online groups
    -   Database credentials
    -   Box.com folders

More resources and offboarding checklists from [Harvard Research Data Management](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/about/where-start/rdm-offboarding-checklist) can be found in our [data-management shared drive](Y:/NRAS/soil-health-initiative/state-of-the-soils/data-management/resources/staff-turnover).

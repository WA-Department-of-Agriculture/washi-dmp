# Formats and standards

## Data formats

Data generated from or integrated into WaSHI can be non-digital or digital.

### Non-digital data

Non-digital data, such as field forms, management surveys, and chain of custody forms, are manually recorded on paper forms. Paper forms must be transcribed or converted to digital file formats and then stored in the WaSHI filing cabinet in the Natural Resources Building in Olympia.

### Digital data

Digital data include tabular, spatial, and binary data, such as lab results, sample locations, and field photos. Non-conventional data also include code, algorithms, tools, and workflows.

**Tabular data** include comma separated values (csv), tab separated values (tsv), Microsoft Excel open XML spreadsheet (xlsx), and portable document format (pdf).

**Spatial data** include file geodatabases (gdb), vector shapefiles (zipped folder containing multiple file extensions), keyhole markup language (kml or kmz). Tabular data may also contain spatial data as longitude and latitude.

**Binary data** include photos (jpeg, png, gif, tiff), videos (mp4), code (R, py, js), and object-oriented data files (RDS, Rdata, parquet, arrow).

**Proprietary data formats** include Microsoft Excel, Word, and Powerpoint files (xlsx, docx, pptx). RDS and Rdata files are an example of an application-specific data format that can only be opened using the R programming language or RStudio IDE. These types of files should be saved in conjunction with a copy of the data in a non-proprietary and open-standard format, such as csv, to maintain accessibility for those who do not have Microsoft Office or do not use R.

**Written documents and presentations** are in formats including Microsoft Word and Powerpoint (docx and pptx), hypertext markup language (HTML), and pdf.

**Notebooks** combine text with executable code to generate written documents and presentations in docx, pptx, HTML, or pdf formats. These notebooks are stored in formats depending on the programming language: a few examples include R markdown (rmd), Quarto (qmd), and Jupyter notebook (ipynb).

The list below is not exhaustive and will continue to grow as additional useful data sources are discovered.

## Data standards {#sec-data-standards}

**Date** will be expressed as `YYYY-MM-DD` according to the [ISO 8601 standard](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html).

**Date with time** will be expressed as YYYY-MM-DD**T**HH:MM:SS**Z**.

-   **T** separates date from time. The **Z** indicates the date-time is using the Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) with no offset.
-   Pacific Standard Time (PST) has a UTC-8:00 offset and Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) has a UTC-7:00 offset and would be expressed as YYYY-MM-DD**T**HH:MM:SS-8:00. The **Z** has been replaced with the offset.
-   Example: `2023-11-28T14:55:56-08:00`.

**Geospatial** data will be accompanied by metadata that abides by the [ISO 19115 standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html) by following Esri's [documentation](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/metadata/create-iso-19115-and-iso-19139-metadata.htm) when working in ArcGIS Pro. Metadata contains information about the identification, the extent, the quality, the spatial and temporal schema, spatial reference, and distribution of digital geographic data.

**Code** will follow the style guide in @sec-code-style-guide.

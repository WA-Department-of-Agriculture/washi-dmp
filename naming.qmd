# Naming conventions {#sec-naming}

When naming folders and files, we want consistent and clear names that are findable and understandabe by both humans and computers. From only a file name, we should immediately know what the file contains and which file is the most recent version.

!["Documents" from Randall Munroe's xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/documents.png){width="250"}

## Why are conventions important?

-   Improves consistency and predictability, making it easier to browse folders and know what the file/folder contains.

-   Easily sort and retrieve files by date, conservation district, or other theme.

-   Facilitates collaboration so all team members can find the information they need.

-   Standardizes file paths and URLs for efficient programming and website hosting.

      -   URLs and programming languages are case-sensitive. `WaSHI-data.csv` and `washi-data.csv` are completely different files.
      
      -   URLs cannot have spaces in them. They must be escaped with this character entity `%20`. `wasoilhealth.org/producer spotlights` would need to be `wasoilhealth.org/producer%20spotlights`.

For more web-specific naming conventions, see this [Learn the Web webpage](https://learntheweb.courses/topics/naming-conventions/).

## Best practices {#sec-naming-best-practices}

*Many files and folders in our shared drive do not follow the above best practices or below naming conventions. We are learning and improving as we go.* Going forward, please follow the conventions listed below.

These are guidelines and naming things is hard, so try your best. If you're not sure how to name a folder or file, talk with Jadey. If you're adding a bunch of files that came from somewhere else, ask Jadey to help you organize and bulk rename them.

See @sec-naming-examples for a table of examples of folder and file names using these best practices.

### Meaningful name casing

Different conventions work better for different purposes (folders and file versus programming objects). 

  -   **kebab-case**: all lowercase with hyphens separating words. Use for all **folders and files**.
  
  -   **snake_case**: all lowercase with underscores separating words. Only use for **code**, such as functions and variables in R. See [@sec-objects-functions] for example R errors when including hyphens in object names.
  
  -   **UpperCamelCase**: first letter of each word is capitalized. Only use for **variables** in spreadsheets and tables. If we used snake_case, the soil health indicators with units would be way too long. Using an `_` to separate the measurement from the unit allows us to more easily transform our data with code. `96HrMinC_MgCKgDay` instead of `96_hr_min_c_mg_kg_day`. See @sec-vars-code and @sec-variables-in-a-dataset for more details.

### Delimiters convey meaning

Deliberately use underscores and hyphens so we can easily understand the contents and programmatically parse file and folder names.

-   Use underscores to delineate metadata elements (i.e. date from name from version `date_name_version`).

-   Use hyphens to separate parts of one metadata element (i.e. date `YYYY-MM-DD` or name `wsda-washi-presentation`).

### No spaces or special characters

Avoid spaces and special characters (only use underscores and hyphens). Characters like `/` `()` `!` `?` `%` `+` `"` `'` have special meaning to computers and can break file paths and URLs.

### Character length matters

Computers are unable to read file paths and file names that surpass a certain character length. Be concise AND descriptive. Windows path limit is 260 characters.

### 'Back to front' date

Remember to express date 'back to front' of `YYYY-MM-DD` according to the [ISO 8601 standard](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html). This maintains the chronological order of records when they are sorted alphanumerically.

### Group & sort files by name

Consider how folders and files should be grouped and sorted. Put that piece of metadata in the beginning of the file name.

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Sort by district                | Sort by date                    |

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+

### Version numbers {#sec-version-numbers}

If not using the date to version, or to keep multiple drafts from the same date, add version information to the end of the file name. Think about how many possible versions there could be. If there may be more than 10, use leading zeros before single digit numbers so the file name always has the same length. V1 through V15 will not sort the same way as V01 through V15.

| sop_v11.pdf                     | ... \[V3 - V9\]       |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------+

### Collaboration

Add your initials at the end of the file name when "saving as" a file that multiple people are working on (i.e., `2023-11-14_sop-soil-health-monitoring_lm_jr.docx`). This ensures a version is kept as a backup. Alternatively, use [Track Changes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/track-changes-in-word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a) if working in a MS Word document.

### Variables and code  {#sec-vars-code}

Naming conventions for variables and code differ from folders and files. The hyphens in kebab-case cause errors in R and SQL code. Additionally, hyphens, spaces, and other special characters are [invalid for ArcGIS table and field names](https://support.esri.com/en-us/knowledge-base/faq-what-characters-should-not-be-used-in-arcgis-for-fi-000005588).

-   Use **UpperCamelCase** for **variables** (column names of spreadsheets and tables). 

-   Use **snake_case** for naming **code objects**, including R data structures (vectors, lists, dataframes) and functions.

In variable names, we include the measurement with the unit for clarity and self-documentation when sharing our data. This prevents unit confusion and reduces the risk of misinterpreting or inappropriately using the data. UpperCamelCase with an underscore to separate the measurement from the unit helps with readability and consistency.

Do not use special characters. Instead of `TOC_%`, use `TOC_Percent`.

See @sec-code-style-guide for more details in the code style guide.

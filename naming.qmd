# Naming conventions {#sec-naming}

When naming folders and files, use consistent and clear names that are findable 
and understandable by both humans and computers. A file name should convey what 
it contains and which file is the most recent version.

## Why are conventions important?

::: {.column style="width: 65%"}
-   Improves consistency and predictability, making it easier to browse folders
    and know what they contain.

-   Enables sorting files by date, conservation district, or another theme.

-   Facilitates collaboration so all team members can find the information they
    need.

-   Standardizes file paths and URLs for efficient programming and website
    hosting.

    -   URLs and programming languages are case-sensitive. `WaSHI-data.csv` and
        `washi-data.csv` are completely different files.

    -   URLs cannot have spaces in them. They must be escaped with this
        character entity `%20`. For example,
        `wasoilhealth.org/producer spotlights` would need to be
        `wasoilhealth.org/producer%20spotlights`.

webpage](https://learntheweb.courses/topics/naming-conventions/).

## Best practices {#sec-naming-best-practices}

**Some files and folders in our shared drive do not follow these best practices
or naming conventions. We are learning and improving as we go.**

These are just guidelines. Because naming things is hard, we only ask that you
try your best. If you're unsure about names or adding externally named
files, the Data Scientist can support you.

See @sec-naming-examples for a table of examples of folder and file names
following these best practices.

### Meaningful name casing

Different conventions work for different purposes (folders and files versus
programming objects).

-   **kebab-case**: all lowercase with hyphens separating words. Use for
    **folders** and **files**.

-   **snake_case**: all lowercase with underscores separating words. Only use
    for **column names** in spreadsheets and **code**, such as functions and
    variables in R. See [@sec-objects-functions] for example R errors when
    including hyphens in object names.

A snake screams \"SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE\" into the face of a camel (wearing ear muffs) with \"camelCase\" written along its back. Vegetables on a skewer spell out \"kebab-case\" (words on a skewer). A mellow, happy looking snake has text \"snake_case\" along it."}

### Delimiters convey meaning

Deliberately use underscores and hyphens so we can easily understand the
contents and programmatically parse file and folder names.

-   Use underscores to delineate metadata elements (i.e. date from name from
    version `date_name_version`).

-   Use hyphens to separate parts of one metadata element (i.e. date
    `YYYY-MM-DD` or name `wsda-washi-presentation`).

### No spaces or special characters

Avoid spaces and special characters (only use underscores and hyphens).
Characters like `/` `()` `!` `?` `%` `+` `"` `'` have special meaning to
computers and can break file paths and URLs.

### Character length matters

Computers are unable to read file paths and file names that surpass a certain
character length. Be concise AND descriptive. Omit prepositions and articles
when possible. Abbreviate long words. The path limit on Windows is 260
characters.

### 'Back to front' date

Express date 'back to front' like `YYYY-MM-DD` according to the [ISO
8601 standard](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html). Left pad
single-digit months and days with zeros to maintain chronological order
of records when sorting alphanumerically.

### Group & sort files by name

Consider how folders and files should be grouped and sorted, and include the
appropriate metadata at the beginning of the file name. See examples below.

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Sort by district                    | Sort by date                        |
+=====================================+=====================================+

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

### Version numbers {#sec-version-numbers}

Including the date in the file name is one way to version a file. Alternatively,
or in addition to, append a number. Consider how many possible versions
there could be. If more than 10, use leading zeros so the numbers have the same
length. v1 through v15 will not sort the same way as v01 through v15.

+--------------------------------+---------------------+
| ... \[v03 - v09\]              | SOP_v11.pdf         |
+--------------------------------+---------------------+
| sop_v10.pdf                    | SOP_v2.pdf          |
+--------------------------------+---------------------+
| sop_v11.pdf                    | ... \[v3 - v9\]     |
+--------------------------------+---------------------+

### Collaboration

Add your initials to the end of the file name when "saving as" a file that
multiple people are working on (i.e.,
`2023_sop-soil-health-monitoring_lm-jr.docx`). This ensures a version is kept as
a backup. Alternatively, use [Track
Changes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/track-changes-in-word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a)
if working in a MS Word document.

### Literature and references

When saving journal articles, user guides, and other reference materials, use
the convention `author_year_abbreviated-title`. Use underscores to separate
different metadata.

### Column names and code {#sec-vars-code}

Naming conventions for data column headers differ from folders and files. The
hyphens in kebab-case cause errors in R and SQL code. Additionally, hyphens,
spaces, and other special characters are [invalid for ArcGIS table and field
names](https://support.esri.com/en-us/knowledge-base/faq-what-characters-should-not-be-used-in-arcgis-for-fi-000005588).

Use **snake_case** for column names in spreadsheets and code objects (R
vectors, lists, dataframes, and functions).

In variable or parameter names, include the measurement with the unit. This
prevents unit confusion and reduces the risk of misinterpreting or
inappropriately using the data.

Do not use special characters. Instead of `toc_%`, use `toc_percent`.

::: callout-note
The code naming convention here applies primarily to R. Python and other programming languages have different conventions.
